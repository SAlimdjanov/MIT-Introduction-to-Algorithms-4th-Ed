# Insertion Sort

**Sorting Problem:** you neeed to sort a sequence of numbers into monotonically increasing order. **Insertion Sort** solves this problem.

#### Input

A sequence of $n$ numbers $\langle{a_1, a_2, ... , a_n}\rangle{}$

#### Output

A permutation $\langle{a_1^{'}, a_2^{'}, ... , a_n^{'}}\rangle{}$ of the input sequence such that $a_1^{'} < a_2^{'} < ... < a_n^{'}$.

The numbers to be sorted are known as **keys**. The input comes in the form of an array with $n$ elements. When we want to sort numbers, it is often because the keys are associated with other data, which we call satellite data.
